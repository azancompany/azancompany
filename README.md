# Company Site Fixed (AR/EN)

Ready for GitHub Pages. Includes `.nojekyll`, proper relative paths, and cache-busted assets.

## Deploy
1) Upload contents of the folder to your repo root (branch `main`).
2) Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → `main` / `(root)`.
3) Wait 1–2 minutes. If under a project site (USERNAME.github.io/REPO), all relative paths work.

## Notes
- Static site, no backend. Use Formspree or similar for contact.
- Customize colors in `assets/css/style.css` under `:root`.
